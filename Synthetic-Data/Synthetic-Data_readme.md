## Synthetic Data

**The synthetic dataset, i.e. fake brain-like data, were generated for 9 different b-values (0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ms/um2) and with 32 repetitions for each b-values.**

This folder contains:
***(1) a synthetic dataset (i.e. fake brain-like dataset) which was generated by
1. generating FIDs for brain metabolites using Matlab routines for the STEAM sequence (TE=45ms, TM=60ms, npoints 1024, spectral width 3000Hz, 7Tesla)
2. combining FIDs using a weighted sum, based on concentrations and T2 values from the litterature
3. applying an attenuation factor to mimic signal attenuation due to diffusion-weighting 
4. adding a macromolecule baseline with a specific attenuation factor for each b-values 
5. adding a water residual with a specific attenuation factor for each b-values 
6. applying line-broadening
7. adding random noise for each repetitions and b-values
8. adding a frequency and phase drift for each repetitions and b-values
      
*Files names are **SyntheticData.mat, SyntheticData^X^^^_DWS_b9_nsa32_raw_act.SPAR/.SDAT, SyntheticData^X^^^_DWS_b9_nsa32_raw_act.nii** *
*The data are saved in .mat (matrix with dimmension [npoints(1024),b-values(9),averages(32)] as well as in philips format (.SPAR/SDAT) and in .nii format.* 
*For the philips/nii format the array is saved as follow: [(av1,b1),(av1,b2),...,(av1,b9),(av2,b1),(av2,b2),...,(av2,b9),...(av32,b1),(av32,b2),...,(av32,b9)].*
      
(2) an original dataset which is generated similarly as above without noise or drift (steps a to f).

      The data are saved in .mat (matrix with dimmension [npoints(1024),b-values(9),averages(32)] as well as in philips format (.SPAR/SDAT) and in .nii format.

(3) a basis-set to fit the data in LCModel or other preferred software

      --> basis_STEAM_TE45_TM60.BASIS
      
(4) a control file for LCModel fit, which provides a starting point (feel free to adapt to your preferred settings)

      --> synthetic.control

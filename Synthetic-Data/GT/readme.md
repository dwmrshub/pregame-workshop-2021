### Ground truth files

## matlab

* Phase and frequency drifts: ground_truth_freq_phas_conc.mat, tables all_dyn_phase and all_dyn_freq. Shifts applied to the ground truth data.
* Relative concentrations at b=0 (relative to tCr): ground_truth_freq_phas_conc.mat, structure metab_b0. 
* Grounds truth decay for all metabolites at the 9 chosen b values: GT_decay.mat 

## json and csv 

* Phase and frequency drifts: freq_shifts.csv, phase_shifts.csv. Shifts applied to the ground truth data.
* Relative concentrations at b=0 (relative to tCr): metab_bo.txt, in the format of a json file. 
* Grounds truth decay for all metabolites at the 9 chosen b values: decay_metab.txt (json)
